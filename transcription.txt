[00:00.000 --> 00:05.840]  And finally, something that sounds people often forget, which is efficiency, being
[00:05.840 --> 00:11.080]  really organised. Selling's not just about being good with the talk or the listening,
[00:11.080 --> 00:15.080]  but it's also about being organised. So when you go to a meeting with a
[00:15.080 --> 00:18.240]  customer you've got to be on time, everything's got to be right, it's got to be
[00:18.240 --> 00:23.880]  neat and tidy, no typos, their names got to be spelled correctly, everything's
[00:23.880 --> 00:29.040]  got to be spot on because they're judging the whole company by you and if you
[00:29.040 --> 00:33.400]  don't get things right, what hope have they got after they've bought from you? So
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.160]  everything's got to be right and you've got to be easy to get hold of as well. So
[00:37.160 --> 00:41.120]  your answer phone message should be personalized with your name and some sort of
[00:41.120 --> 00:44.640]  promise of when you're going to get back to them and your emails should have a
[00:44.640 --> 00:50.120]  footer with your telephone number on and also your email address because
[00:50.120 --> 00:53.920]  remember they might print it out and then they have lost your email address
[00:53.920 --> 00:58.640]  unless it's printed on there. So be easy to contact and be really organised.
[00:58.640 --> 01:03.040]  And then you'll be ahead of most other salespeople.
